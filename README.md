# RecyclerViewJSON

RecyclerView with Volley and Picasso :-


This project demonstrates how to use RecyclerView, Volley, and Picasso libraries to display a list of images from the Pixabay API. The app fetches data from the API in JSON format using Volley, and then parses the data to display the images in a RecyclerView. The images are loaded and cached using Picasso, which also handles resizing and scaling the images for display.
